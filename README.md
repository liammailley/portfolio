coding styles: use white space. indent properly. indent nested things. put each CSS rule on its own line. USE COMMENTS.

functionality: everything needs to work. IMAGES NEEEED TO BE WEBP OR RESIZED TO EXACT SIZE. ADD ANIMATIONS AND TRANSITIONS TO LINKS.

design: text contrast. look at spacing, typography, measure, leading, etc. We also need inclusive design.
